# Learn  

This deno module is inspired by an [education project](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/ffc) of 
[DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de/startseite). It optimizes learning processes.

One of its key features is to optimize flash card based and conversation based learning by leveraging feedbackloops.  

This module uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning to optimize human learning processes.
